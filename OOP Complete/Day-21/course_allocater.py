'''
TechWorld, a technology training center, wants to allocate courses for instructors. An instructor is identified by name, technology skills,
 experience and average feedback. An instructor is allocated a course, if he/she satisfies the below two conditions:

eligibility criteria:
if experience is more than 3 years, average feedback should be 4.5 or more
if experience is 3 years or less, average feedback should be 4 or more
he/she should posses the technology skill for the course
Identify the class name and attributes to represent instructors. Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

Note:

Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public.
An instructor may have multiple technology skills, so consider instance variable, technology_skill to be a list.
check_eligibility(): Return true if eligibility criteria is satisfied by the instructor. Else, return false
allocate_course(technology): Return true if the course which requires the given technology can be allocated to the instructor. Else, return false.
Represent a few objects of the class, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.
